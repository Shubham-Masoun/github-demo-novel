Nick Carraway—the narrator. Thirty years old, he is a moralist who becomes a foil to every other character. He
lives next door to Jay Gatsby and, thus, becomes Gatsby’s link to Daisy, his cousin.

Jay Gatsby—the title character. A romantic idealist, he devotes his life to amassing wealth which he believes
will win Daisy and thus fulfill his dream.

Daisy Buchanan—Nick’s cousin, Tom’s wife, and Gatsby’s dream girl. Incapable of love, she represents the
idolized upper class.

Tom Buchanan—Daisy’s husband. Incapable of feeling guilt or any other emotion, he represents brutality, the
moral carelessness of the rich, pseudo-intellectualism, and racism.
